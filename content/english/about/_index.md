An enthusiast exploring the ever-evolving landscape of emerging technologies. With an insatiable curiosity and a fervent passion for learning, I delve into new realms to uncover innovative solutions. I am deeply committed to advocating for equitable and inclusive technology, striving to understand and address biases in artificial intelligence.

Currently, I am engaged in an independent study under the guidance of Professor Haewoon Kwak, where I explore the fascinating world of AI-generated children's stories and illustrations. My goal is to assess the intricate web of gender, racial, and other biases woven into these narratives and images produced by cutting-edge machine learning models. Through rigorous analysis and comparison, I aim to shed light on the nuances of bias propagation across multiple large language models (LLMs).

The generation of biased stories by LLMs can have a profound impact on today's children. These narratives play a crucial role in shaping young minds, influencing their perceptions and attitudes. Biased content perpetuated by AI systems risks reinforcing harmful stereotypes, contributing to inequality and discrimination from an early age. Understanding and mitigating these biases are crucial steps towards fostering a more inclusive and equitable future for the next generation.
