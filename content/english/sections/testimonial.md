# Testimonials
testimonials:
  - name: "Equijob: Balancing Bias in Job Descriptions"
    designation: "https://github.com/bhargavithanneeru/Equi-Job-Omdena-Project.git"
    content:
      - "Applied Python, SKLearn, and database skills to ’EquiJob,’ using advanced AI models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, LSTM) to reduce job description bias and enhance inclusive hiring."
      - "Played a key role in dataset curation, model development, and project discussions, showcasing active participation, commitment to innovation, and a strong skill set in data science and AI technologies."

  - name: "PawlidayInn - Hotel Booking Management using MERN stack"
    designation: "https://github.com/bhargavithanneeru/Hotel-Booking-Management.git"
    content:
      - "Built a Hotel Booking Management web app with MERN stack, featuring user authentication, profile management, and advanced accommodation search functionality."
      - "Developed an admin interface for hotel, user, and room management, including adding, deleting, and updating records."
      - "Successfully deployed the web app on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and implemented data visualization tools for analyzing user trends and profit metrics."

  - name: "Realistic Image Synthesis using StackGan"
    designation: "https://github.com/bhargavithanneeru/Realistic-Image-Synthesis-Using-StackGAN.git"
    content:
      - "Developed a Generative Adversarial Network that is used to generate realistic images from the input text descriptions of the birds. Background is synthesized from noise. There are 2 stages in this model."
      - "Built a generator and a discriminator in each stage. Generator generates the image from text description and discriminator compares the generated image with the nearest neighbor in the training dataset."

  - name: "Object Detection using YOLO-V3"
    designation: "https://github.com/bhargavithanneeru/Object-Detection-Using-YOLOV3.git"
    content:
      - "Developed a python model that identifies the objects in the image. This project involves localisation and classification."
      - "Collaborated with internal team members to ensure that the project will be completed in time."
      - "Trained the model with labeled images and used the Naive way(Divide and Conquer) approach to create the model. FPN topology allowed the YOLO-V3 to learn objects of different sizes."

  - name: "CineTracker - Full Stack Project"
    designation: "https://github.com/bhargavithanneeru/CineTracker.git"
    content:
      - "Developed a web application utilizing movie datasets from Kaggle and Group Lens. Built using ReactJS, Material UI, and ChartJS to create a modern and interactive user interface."
      - "Implemented functionalities including user registration, movie browsing, search, favorite/watchlist management, and statistical insights."
      - "Used NodeJS and a MySQL database for seamless API integration and efficient database management. Deployed the web application on Heroku (backend)."

  - name: "Weather Classification"
    designation: "https://github.com/bhargavithanneeru/WeatherClassification.git"
    content:
      - "Developed and trained ResNet, VGG16, Xception, and CNN models."
      - "Dataset consisted of 12,373 images across 11 weather classes."
      - "Achieved a 93% classification accuracy."
      - "Employed advanced image processing techniques for dataset augmentation and model optimization."
